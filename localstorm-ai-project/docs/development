# Development Documentation for Localstorm AI Project

## Overview
This document provides guidelines and best practices for the development of the Localstorm AI project, including backend services and mobile app components. It aims to facilitate collaboration among developers and ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:

- **backend**: Contains the server-side code, including controllers, services, models, middleware, and routes.
- **frontend**: Contains the client-side code for the web application, including components, pages, hooks, and services.
- **mobile**: Contains the code for the mobile application, including components, screens, services, and navigation.
- **shared**: Contains shared types and utility functions used across the backend and frontend.
- **docs**: Contains documentation related to the API, deployment, and development processes.
- **scripts**: Contains scripts for setting up, deploying, and testing the application.

## Development Guidelines

### Backend Development
1. **Controllers**: Each controller should handle a specific set of related functionalities. Ensure that functions are well-documented and follow a consistent naming convention.
2. **Services**: Services should encapsulate business logic and interact with models. Keep service methods focused on a single responsibility.
3. **Models**: Define models using appropriate schemas for database interactions. Ensure that validation is implemented where necessary.
4. **Middleware**: Use middleware for authentication, security, and monitoring. Ensure that middleware functions are reusable and modular.
5. **Routes**: Define routes clearly and group them logically. Use descriptive names for route handlers.

### Frontend Development
1. **Components**: Build reusable components that follow the principles of separation of concerns. Each component should manage its own state and props.
2. **Pages**: Organize pages to represent different views in the application. Use routing to navigate between pages.
3. **Hooks**: Create custom hooks for shared logic across components. Ensure hooks are well-tested and documented.
4. **Services**: Implement services for API interactions. Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.

### Mobile Development
1. **Components**: Similar to frontend components, mobile components should be reusable and maintainable. Use React Native best practices for styling and layout.
2. **Screens**: Each screen should represent a distinct view in the mobile app. Use navigation to transition between screens.
3. **Services**: Implement services for managing API requests, offline capabilities, and notifications. Ensure that services are optimized for mobile performance.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components and services to ensure functionality.
- Implement integration tests to validate interactions between components.
- Conduct performance tests to measure responsiveness and load handling.

## Deployment
- Follow the deployment guidelines outlined in the `docs/deployment` directory.
- Ensure that environment variables are properly configured in the `.env` file.
- Use Docker for containerization and deployment of the application.

## Conclusion
Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain a high-quality codebase and facilitate collaboration among team members. For any questions or clarifications, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the team leads.
