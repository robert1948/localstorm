"""
Task 1.2.1 Rate Limiting Integration Tests
==========================================

Tests to validate rate limiting middleware integration and functionality.
Tests confirm rate limits are active, proper headers are returned, and 
excessive requests are blocked as expected.

Success Criteria:
- Rate limiting middleware is properly integrated
- Rate limits are enforced for API endpoints
- Proper rate limit headers are returned
- 429 status code returned when limits exceeded
- Different rate limits applied to different endpoint types
