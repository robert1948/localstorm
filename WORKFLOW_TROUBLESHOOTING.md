# üîç Workflow Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status Analysis

### From GitHub Actions Screenshot:
- ‚ùå Manual runs (#5, #4) are failing
- ‚úÖ Automatic run (#3) succeeded
- Pattern: Manual workflow_dispatch triggers are having issues

## Likely Issues:

### 1. Production Deployment Dependencies
The manual runs might be trying to deploy to production, but failing because:
- Missing environment variables in GitHub Secrets
- Heroku API key issues
- S3 upload configuration problems

### 2. Input Validation
The workflow expects `deploy_to_production = "YES"` but might be getting different values.

## Quick Diagnostic Steps:

### Step 1: Check Secrets
Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
Verify these exist:
- `HEROKU_API_KEY`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` 
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Step 2: Test Simple Manual Run
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Unified CI/CD Pipeline
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Leave `deploy_to_production` as default "NO"
4. This should only run tests, not deploy

### Step 3: Check Recent Manual Runs
If you set `deploy_to_production = "YES"`, it will try to:
- Build frontend
- Upload to S3
- Deploy to Heroku
- All of these need proper secrets configured

## Recommended Action:
Try a manual run with `deploy_to_production = "NO"` first to isolate the issue.
